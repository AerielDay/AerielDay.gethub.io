<!--
							<p>Hi my name is Aeriel Day and I am a self-made developer. While in college working on a degree for psychology I took a beginners course for basic website development. I thought at the time that it would just be one of those classes everyone takes in college simply for the credits. I have no idea
								that taking this small two credit course would change the entire course of my life. I found that web development and programming as a whole was what I had been looking for as a career. 
								it offered challenge, the reward of figuring out how to say things so the computer would understand it and it offered an artistic outlet for my imagination to roam. Those things alone
								would have sold me on the idea of becoming a developer but the perk of getting to make money was an added bonus. I decided within a couple days that I no longer cared as much about getting a degree in psychology;
								instead I wanted to jump head first into becoming a developer. I talked to my older brother about this utopia I found and he suggested that I should just make computer science my minor for the time. doing so would allow me to finish my degree in psychology that I was a single semeter away from completing, but it would
								also let me start to work on my real passion of programming. since leaving college I learned any programming language I could get my hands on the course material for. the most I practiced this craft the more I loved it. I found pretty quickly that I was a natural when it comes to understanding programming. I guess 
								being ASD helped. I spent a couple years after college just building my foundation and looking at what companies were looking for in there fresh hires. after my basic 
								foundation was built I started applying like crazy and quickly discovered just how competative this industry was; that wasn't factoring in that as a women I was trying
								to become employed in a male dominated field. 
							</p>
							<p>
								I discovered that if I wanted to ever be a developer I needed to have some sort of experience beyond the classroom. to accomplish this, I became a freelance developer and technition
								friends, family, coworkers, pretty much anyone who would listen, I would tell them about my endevers and explain that I would build any website design ideas they had or work on any computer issue
								all for free if they would let me do so and let me use them as a reference for further freelance work. In the beginning some of my attempts weren't great. I was discovering where my weak points where and 
								what needed to be done to fix them. I was also quickly understanding that I had less than zero understanding of color theory. Thankfully my youngest brother is quite gifted in art so he has helped me understand the basics over the years. 
								I also found out that I loved taking other people's idea and trying to make them a reality. I am not the best at figuring out my own ideas and bringing those into existance. 
							</p>
							<p>for a few years I stayed at the grind of being a freelance developer and suring up my foundation in programming. I was still having issues getting a paying job in the field though
								I started looking into apprenticeships which also landed me in a temp job using ServiceNow from a customer service perspective. I came across "New Apprenticeship" and was surprised to find that they were going to train me in how to use the very same platform I had been using for a few months now. They let me into their program for free and trained me the basics of ServiceNow and got me an opportunity
								to interview with a company. At the end of the apprenticeship I was hired by this company as a full time servicenow platform developer.
							</p>
							<p>I worked for them for 2 years and some odd months. It may not have been the best pay for my abilities, but I wouldn't have traded the opportunity that it gave me to grow and get further training
								in both ServiceNow and programming in general. I am at the point in my career where I feel that it is time for me to have a role that is not in the position of an apprentice or an intern. As for my future goals, I will continue
								to reach for perfection in every aspect as I believe that true perfection is not something that can be obtained because there is <b>ALWAYS</b> room for improvement in every aspect of ones life. 
								I will continue to learn new things and enjoy literally every part of programming from the sharing of the vision of the end result to the delivery and maintance of the creation. 
								The only thing I truely look for is a culture that allows growth, a good work and family balance, and a continuous flow of new ideas to help bring about.
